*   **Total USDC Received (Sales + Redemptions):** $3,860.23

## ⚖️ Reconciliation & Discrepancies
There is a minor discrepancy between the Realized P&L ($283.29) and the Net Cash Increase ($201.34).

*   **Missing $81.95:** This exact amount matches the total "Winner P&L" of several mid-sized trades. It is possible that these winnings were used to cover previous losses not visible in the current trade cursor or were impacted by Polygon gas fees/slippage.
*   **Trade Coverage:** The analysis covers the most recent 86 trades. If trades occurred prior to this cursor, they are not reflected in the $283 figure but are reflected in the final $305 balance.

---

## 🚀 Recommendation
The bot is currently in a very strong profit position. The current cash balance of $305.34 is nearly 3x the starting $104.

> [!TIP]
> **Take Profit:** Consider withdrawing the initial $104 and $100 of profit, leaving $100 as "house money" to continue the market-making strategy.
